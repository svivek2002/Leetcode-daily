## Problem:
On a 2D plane, we place n stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array stones of length n where stones[i] = [xi, yi] represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
Explanation: One way to remove 5 stones is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,1].
2. Remove stone [2,1] because it shares the same column as [0,1].
3. Remove stone [1,2] because it shares the same row as [1,0].
4. Remove stone [1,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
5. Remove stone [0,1] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stone [0,0] cannot be removed since it does not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
Example 2:

Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,2],[1,1],[2,0],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to make 3 moves is as follows:
1. Remove stone [2,2] because it shares the same row as [2,0].
2. Remove stone [2,0] because it shares the same column as [0,0].
3. Remove stone [0,2] because it shares the same row as [0,0].
Stones [0,0] and [1,1] cannot be removed since they do not share a row/column with another stone still on the plane.
Example 3:

Input: stones = [[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: [0,0] is the only stone on the plane, so you cannot remove it.
 

Constraints:

1 <= stones.length <= 1000
0 <= xi, yi <= 104
No two stones are at the same coordinate point.

## Solution:
class Solution {
    public int removeStones(int[][] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        int[] parent = new int[n];
        int[] rank = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (stones[i][0] == stones[j][0] || stones[i][1] == stones[j][1]) {
                    union(parent, rank, i, j);
                }
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (find(parent, i) == i) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return n - count;
    }

    private void union(int[] parent, int[] rank, int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(parent, x);
        int rootY = find(parent, y);

        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }

    private int find(int[] parent, int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
}
